1. Improved Javadoc
Java 9 update came with updated Java documentation. We no longer need to use Google to find the right documentation. 
The new Javadoc came with search rights in the API documentation itself. Moreover, the Javadoc output was HTML5 compliant. 
Every Javadoc page includes information on which JDK module the class or interface comes from.
